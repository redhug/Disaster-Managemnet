# Disaster-Management

## Introduction:
There exist systems to manage emergency or disaster situations. However, these systems lack quick communication and the ability to predict and visualize the locations of several response teams in different areas simultaneously. We propose an approach to identify and view the rescue teams and to manage those teams using the web application with data services stored in cloud. The same data services will be used by the mobile applications, which is out of the scope of this research.
